Since there's always inevitable hiccups getting a new Maven setup off the ground, in the interest of time I just included jars of the basic selenium libraries and the JUnit 5 [junit-platform-console-standalone](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:junit-platform-console-standalone).


If it matters, project was put together in Visual Studio Code instead of, say, Eclipse.
There may be necessary plugins to install if going the VSC route as I did.
